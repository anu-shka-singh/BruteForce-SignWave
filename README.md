Our goal is to create a platform that promotes inclusive communication.

Our platform is designed to enable people with hearing, visual, or speech impairments to communicate freely, providing them with a sense of independence and empowerment. 
By providing a comprehensive suite of communication tools, we hope to bridge the gap between different abilities and enable all individuals to communicate effectively and confidently.

Our platform offers real-time speech-to-sign language, sign language-to-speech and text-to-speech conversion.
We understand that different impairments require different functionalities, and we aim to provide a one-stop platform that caters to all. 

We generated our own dataset for sign language to speech conversion. You can find the dataset at : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A8TKmLTrZKukbSit_ucabC9vFtBMuaWv/view?usp=sharing
